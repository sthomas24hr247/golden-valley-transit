## 5. CONTRACT NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### RATE NEGOTIATION TIPS

**Know Your Costs First:**
```
Fixed Costs (per vehicle):
- Vehicle payment/lease: $500-800/month
- Insurance: $300-600/month per vehicle
- Licensing/permits: $100-200/month
- Maintenance: $200-400/month

Variable Costs (per trip):
- Fuel: $5-15 per trip (depending on distance)
- Driver wages: $15-25 per hour (CA minimum wage + benefits)
- Administrative overhead: 15-20% of revenue
- Claims processing: 3-5% of revenue

Target Profit Margin: 15-25%
```

**Typical Reimbursement Rates in California:**

Medi-Cal/Medicaid Rates (non-negotiable, set by state):
- Ambulatory: $25-35 base + $2-3/mile
- Wheelchair: $40-50 base + $2.50-3.50/mile
- Stretcher: $90-120 base + $3-4/mile

Private Insurance Rates (negotiable):
- Ambulatory: $35-50 base + $2.50-3.50/mile
- Wheelchair: $50-75 base + $3-4/mile
- Stretcher: $125-175 base + $4-5/mile

Direct Facility Contracts (highly negotiable):
- Aim for 20-30% above Medi-Cal rates
- Volume discounts for recurring business
- Bundle pricing for round trips

**Negotiation Points:**

1. **Base Rate:**
   - Start 10-15% above minimum acceptable
   - Justify with quality metrics, technology, reliability
   - Reference competitor pricing (if known)

2. **Mileage Rate:**
   - Negotiate loaded vs. empty miles
   - Consider zone pricing (flat rates for certain areas)
   - Adjust for fuel cost escalation

3. **Wait Time:**
   - First 15-30 minutes free
   - After that: $25-40/hour
   - Important for dialysis and infusion centers

4. **Additional Services:**
   - Attendant accompaniment (usually no charge, member benefit)
   - Same-day/urgent requests (25-50% premium)
   - After-hours (10 PM-6 AM): 20-30% premium
   - Weekends/holidays: 15-25% premium

5. **Performance Incentives:**
   - Request bonus payments for:
     * >95% on-time performance
     * >4.5/5.0 customer satisfaction
     * Zero preventable accidents
     * Low complaint rate

6. **Volume Commitments:**
   - Offer reduced rates for guaranteed minimum trips/month
   - Negotiate exclusive provider status
   - Lock in rates for longer contract terms

7. **Payment Terms:**
   - Push for 30-day payment terms (better than 45-60 typical)
   - Request electronic payment (faster)
   - Negotiate interest on late payments (15% annually CA standard)

### CONTRACTUAL PROTECTIONS TO NEGOTIATE

**Always Include:**

1. **Rate Escalation Clause**
   - Annual CPI adjustment
   - Fuel cost adjustment mechanism
   - Labor cost adjustment (tied to CA minimum wage changes)

2. **Termination Protection**
   - Require 90-day notice for termination without cause
   - Allow 30-day termination for cause (both sides)
   - Define "cause" clearly (consistent breach, loss of license, etc.)

3. **Payment Protection**
   - Clear timeline for claim payments (30 days standard)
   - Interest accrual on late payments (15% annual in CA)
   - Dispute resolution process
   - Right to withhold service for non-payment

4. **Liability Limitations**
   - Cap liability where possible
   - Clear insurance responsibility (your insurance primary)
   - Mutual indemnification (both parties protect each other)
   - Force majeure clause (acts of God, disasters, etc.)

5. **Performance Standards**
   - Clearly defined metrics (on-time %, satisfaction scores)
   - Reasonable targets (95% vs. 99%)
   - Measurement methodology specified
   - Cure period before penalties (30 days to fix issues)

6. **Scope Changes**
   - Process for adding/removing services
   - Rate renegotiation triggers
   - Geographic expansion provisions

**Red Flags to Avoid:**

❌ Exclusive contracts without volume guarantees
❌ Unilateral rate reduction clauses
❌ Immediate termination without cause
❌ Unlimited liability exposure
❌ Requirements to use specific (expensive) technology vendors
❌ Non-compete clauses that are too broad
❌ Automatic renewal without rate review
